    "What's up World, welcome to the Python Dayton (PyDay) tutorial on how to interact with and collect data from these cool things called APIs. Before we start the fun, I would like to start by stating that this is a very introductory level tutorial meant for beginners. So if you are an intermediate level or greater python user, this is probably not the python tutorial you are looking for *(Jedi hand wave)*. For those of you who decided to stick it out with me, the following sections will provide some fundamental information about APIs and then move into a step by step example and some additional problems for the reader to work through. With that, let's get started."

    "APIs can be defined as software intermediaries that allow two applications to talk to one another. These systems are hosted on web servers. To put it in a different frame of reference, think back to the last time you used your smart phone. You, the user, interacted with the user interface of the phone by providing a set of instructions which either provided navigation instruction or brought you to the intended destination. An API is very similar, except an API is a computer providing instructions to another computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also think about it like this. You have just been seated in your favorite restaurant and are examining the menu. After you make your dinner selection(s) (dinner == data) a waiter (the messenger) takes your order back to the kitchen where the order is fulfilled. A few moments later, the waiter returns with your order. This is how the API process works. As the user, you first identify what data you would like to retrieve from the API. Once this has been identified you make a request from an API to collect that data. This request, and the method by which it is made, can be thought of as contract between the two servers. The term contract is important for this situation because it implies that there is an understanding between the systems for how a request is made and the data that is subsequently returned."

JSON, or Java Script Object Notation, is a very simple data format that uses a key and value. JSON is a method to store information in an organized, easy-to-access, human-readable format. Additionally, this format provides the ability for users to encode data structures like lists and dictionaries, so they are easily readable by machines."

There are three sections of the menu to choose items from, Appetizers, Entree, and Dessert. You can think of these sections as endpoints which retrieves certain data. The ordering process is very similar between the sections, but each point to a specific pool of data. We will see this as we make our way through the example in the next section. "

    "Just like with any computer system handling data, security becomes an issue. Not all data is meant to be accessible by all people. Most organization providing data must manage the data in a way that it is secure, secret, that it is changed at the appropriate levels, and that it should be made available for external manipulation. This is where the concept of **Authentication** comes into play. Authentication is when an entity proves an identity - you are who you say you are. This differs from the concept of **Authorization** - where an entity proves a right to access. There are three major methods of adding this level of security into an API which we will cover below.\n",

    "* **HTTP Basic Authentication** - an HTTP user supplies a **username** and **password** to the API for authentication.    This method does not require the need for more complex response systems which may include methods such as handshakes, cookies, session IDs, logins, etc. Without proper procedures set in place, this process can be vulnerable to attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **API Keys** - API Keys are a unique generated value which is assigned to each first-time user, signifying the system   recognizes them. This is a very fast and agile method for the system to recognize a user and has been used as the default approach for many API providers. While this method does provide some efficiencies for both users and API providers it does also comes with some insecurities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **OAuth** - OAuth is a token-based combination of both authentication and authorization. In this approach, a user logs into a system which acts as an intermediary on their behalf. The user will forward the request to an authentication server. Pending acceptance of this authentication, the token is then provided to the user and then to the requester. The token comes with limited scope and age of validity.\n",
